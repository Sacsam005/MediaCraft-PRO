> Fellow developers, we have integrated the [RemoveBg's API](https://www.remove.bg/api#remove-background) to enable background removal on our website. However, our free trial has expired, because of which the API request throws <span style="color: red">402 Payment Required error</span>. Nonetheless, the code works perfectly fine if a paid version of subscription is used. Feel free to play around with the code with your key.
